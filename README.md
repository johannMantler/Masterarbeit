Simulation Framework for Distributed Database Query Processing in the Semantic Internet of Things


The growing computing capacities of small devices in the Internet of Things (IoT)
have led to the edge computing paradigm. More and more things on the edge of the 
Internet can not only generate data, but also save and process it. One way of using
this computing capacity are distributed database man-agement systems (DBMS) that are
adapted to the IoT platform. The DBMS instances run on the edge devices and cooperate
for query processing. For the development and evaluation of such DBMSs, we present
a new simulator with which modeled instances of a real existing DBMS can be simulated
in a configurable edge computing environment without virtualization. Furthermore,
we present a new protocol for distributed query processing, in which the operator
graph is mapped to the routing tree of an IoT routing protocol and calculated in
a distributed manner. The aim of the protocol is to reduce resource consumption
by executing operators (e.g. joins, filters) as early as possible. Both
contributions are evaluated with the Semantic Web DBMS LUPOSDATE3000 in a modeled example scenario.
